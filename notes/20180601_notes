#Mathematics of Geothermal 
### Linear Regression of Depth and Temperature
- depth = 25.93 * temperature + 128.29
only for higher temperatures!
### Polynomial fit of geothermal power, temperature and extraction rate
- for geothermal power
    - temperature extraction coefficient = temperature * extraction rate (tec)
    - geothermal power = 3.93863416e-17 * tec³ + -8.04762275e-09 * tec² + 7.65096845e-01 * tec + -1.06969341e+05
### Efficiency of Geothermal power and Electrical power
- geothermal power to electrical power (efficiency) is dependent on the turbine
    - median of efficiencies given in data set is 0.1 with a std dev of 0.0964708425658. So everything withing this 
    window is a good turbine
### Issues, which can occur
- efficiency is going down
- extraction rate is varying
